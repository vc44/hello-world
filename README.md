# hello-world

My name is Nicolae-Vladut Craciun, I am 22 years old, I am from Pitesti and I
currently live in Bucharest. I am a student in the first year at the Romanian
American University in Bucharest, Informatics - Economic Master. Since
childhood, my passion for informatics and technology has led me on this path,
and that is why I am looking forward to working in a company which values my
passion and helps me to constantly improve myself and my qualities. My
character and dynamic spirit push me to accumulate new information every
day, and these qualities have always helped me to work both as part of a team
and by myself. I hardly believe that working as a student is an opportunity to
get and develop several abilities and that every situation that comes through
becomes a lesson and a possibily of making the best of it. I am a hard-working
person, who wishes to advance in every area and accumulate all the possible
information because knowledge represents, for myself, the path to success.
The main hobby I have is sports, during my childhood I played tennis for 7
years, so in present, I take every opportunity I have to undertake physical
activities
